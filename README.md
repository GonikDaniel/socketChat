Socket.io chat with node.js
=========

## About ##
- quite typical realization of chat working on web-sockets, using socket.io lib and node.js on server-side
- saving message history even if you log out (you can find whole history after new login)
- typing feature (you can always follow what's going on..)
- neat design provided by Bootstrap and FontAwesome, of course ;)


You can see it working [here]() as well.

## Requirements ##

- node.js, bower and npm installed
- fresh versions of browsers (you'll need web-sockets support and some features are not working in old IE's)
- Passion about programming and clear mind;)

## Quick Start ##

1. First clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/GonikDaniel/socketChat.git
2. Then set the ip address and port according to your personal preferences and system settings (you can do it simply changing ipaddr and port in server.js file (lines 9 and 10) and line 106 in client.js)
3. install node.js + npm (http://nodejs.org/ -> install)
4. npm install
5. bower install
6. npm start


## Details ##
In development I used following versions of node and npm:
node -v ---- v0.12.7
npm -v  ---- 1.4.28

## Config ##
Main config for simplicity right into server.js file
